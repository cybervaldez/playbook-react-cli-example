## How This Was Made

Generated via the playbook's kickstart process:

```bash
cd cybervaldez-playbook
# Then in Claude Code:
# /kickstart → chose react-with-cli → named the project
```

To create your own project, clone the [playbook](https://github.com/cybervaldez/cybervaldez-playbook) and run the kickstart process.
